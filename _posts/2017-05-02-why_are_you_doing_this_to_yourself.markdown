Life is a grind right now. It sort of feels like I’m running a marathon. And, it’s raining. And, there’s a hole in my shoe. And, I’m naked (just kidding). I mean, it’s a good grind—a rewarding grind. I started Flatiron’s *Online Web Developer Program* about 3 weeks ago, and I can already feel myself growing. I am learning every single day and the “aha!” moments keep rolling in. But, it’s a grind, nonetheless.

The online program is being tacked on to my full-time job, the one I’ve had for almost two years now (I’m a Brand Strategist for a creative marketing company, in case you were curious). I moved in with my parents, so that I could afford the monthly tuition. My commute is 75 minutes, each way. I’m driving the same car I rolled over when I was 16 (picture something from *Mad Max*, but with a lot less horsepower). My mechanic says the alternator is ready to give out any day now; I respond with, “Great.” My alarm goes off at 5am, in the hopes of avoiding rush hour and I’m sitting at my desk by 7:15am, with Learn.co open in my browser. Work is 9:00am to 5:30pm and then I’m back to Learn for another hour or two before starting the commute home. My eyes, when I can keep them open, are starting to have tinges of “bloodshot red” around the edges.

My friends think I’m nuts. My average “text-message-response-time” is around 4 days. They ask me to happy hour and I tell them I already made plans for “code hour.” They frequently make jokes about my nonexistent dating life. Apparently, girls don’t find it very romantic when you try to plan a 2 hour date for 2 or 3 weeks in the future—something about not being “spontaneous”. Whatever.

People at work think I’m nuts. Our VP of Production used to be the first person in the office every morning. Now he sees me sitting there on my personal laptop everyday and mutters, “Good morning?” as he passes with a confused look on his face. It’s a similar look that I get at 6pm when the “late leavers” are heading out the door and I’m eating dinner #1, still at my desk, my black laptop open in front of me. When people finally ask what the hell I’m doing, I respond quickly with, “Oh, just some homework for a class I’m taking.” I mean, it’s at least half true—right?

“Ok, we get it, you’re nuts. So why *are* you doing this?” Well, thanks for asking. :)

# I want this. (for the qualitative reader)

First the (overly) simplified version: I’m doing this because… **I want it.** I *want* to be a web developer. I *want* to work in technology and build digital experiences. And, anyone who knows me at all, knows that I tend to go after the things that I want.

I’ll admit it… this isn’t the first major “jump” that I’ve done. I’m a curious person, and a bit of a dabbler. I have had a lot of interests over the years and have a tendency to become excited about new things fairly quickly. 

My first interest (which persists today) was music—guitar, specifically. This interest determined my first collegiate experience when I enrolled at *The University of the Arts* in Philadelphia, learning about everything from music theory to improvisation to vocal exercises (which are super annoying, by the way). After three years of spending 3–6 hours a day in white walled practice rooms, I finally admitted to myself (and my parents) that a career in music was unlikely to be rewarding for me—never mind sustainable. 

So, I transferred to *Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)*, in Richmond, to study Marketing. I did this with the intention of landing a career in music business, to pay the bills, while I played in bands on the side (because surely “music business” will be a lucrative career...). While I was there, mostly due to my classmates and great teachers, that interest slowly shifted to the world of brands and brand management. 

When I graduated from school, I almost immediately got picked up by an experiential marketing agency in Alexandria, VA. I started in client services, but quickly wormed my way into the brand strategy department—literally **THE** job that I wanted out of school.

“Ok… so what’s wrong with your job, then?” Honestly… **nothing**. A lot of my classmates at VCU would probably kill for this job. On a surface level, it checks all the culture boxes: casual work environment, “bring your dog to work” fridays,  beer / wine fridge in the kitchen, birthday bashes every single month, and past internal events that have included indoor go-karting and a day of team building at a fancy resort.

But yet…something is missing. It’s the “meat”. For better or for worse, I’m one of those people who is still naive enough to believe that I should be passionate about the work that I am putting out on a daily basis—that the *work* is what really matters. The fact is, I’m not excited about our work. But, it’s not OUR work that I’m less than enthused about; it’s experiential marketing, in general (and hell, maybe even strategy).

So, I decided that it was time for a change and immediately jumped on the job hunt. I reasoned with myself, “Ok, you already have a job. So, the jobs that you apply for should *only* be jobs that you really want (reach jobs?). There is literally nothing to lose.” But, after a few days, I noticed something peculiar. None of the jobs I was putting into my job pipeline were traditional strategy jobs… almost *all* of them were *product* jobs. They were positions at *technology* companies. You could find terms like: SQL, HTML/CSS, agile project management, and user flows in 90% of the job descriptions that piqued my interest. This, I realized, was actually surfacing at my current job, too. Whenever I was conducting research on the campaigns of our competitors, the ones that stuck out to me the most were the ones that utilized innovative technology, in a clever and original way.

This got me thinking, “Maybe it’s time for a change…” But every realization leads to another question, right? The question that this epiphany brought up was one that I would have to literally sit down and think about: “What do I really want in a career? What do I want to be doing with my *life*?”

# Now what? (for the quantitative reader)

So, I did what any person with diagnosed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder would do: I made a spreadsheet. First, I added a list of all the factors that were important to me, when thinking about the ideal career. This included things like: level of enjoyment with the work itself, natural ability with core skills, trend of the industry overall, ability to freelance and be entrepreneurial, relatively high average salary (yes, it definitely matters), and opportunities to get involved outside of the full-time job. I weighted these attributes, and a few others, to account for how important each one was to me. 

Then, I made a list of all the careers I could see myself doing. Luckily, because I have been a dabbler in the past, I had a pretty good idea of what these potential careers were. I realized that all of this “jumping around” I have been doing for the past 4 years wasn’t actually a waste of time (though my extended family would disagree). Simply put, *I have been exploring*. I have been rapidly diving into a lot of different disciplines so that I could organically narrow down the list of possibilities. I know *a little* about *a lot*, and now I am *ready* to know *a lot* about *a little*. 

So, knowing that I wanted to finally set my sights on something (and stick with it), I added the following potential paths to my handy-dandy spreadsheet: Graphic Designer, Digital Strategist, Photographer / Videographer, User Experience Designer, Music Producer, and of course, Web Developer. I now had a list of careers and a list of criteria for those careers to be graded on—time for some honest, rational, unbiased grading.

The results? Web Developer came out on top. It wasn’t even a close competition, actually. Web Development is an exciting and rewarding career that offers:
* reasonably high starting salaries (and room to grow) 
* cool and interesting work 
* an industry that is expected to grow (something like 32% by 2020)
* the ability to freelance / build entrepreneurial projects
* plenty of communities to join and build projects with

And finally, I think it’s something I have a shot of being really good at. With the web dev dabbling I have done in the past, it seems to align really well with the way I naturally think (my next blog will expand on this a little more and tie it to music, specifically). The concepts have made sense to me, so far; and when they haven’t, I have had the perseverance to work through them.

# Validated?

So, here I am. About 3 weeks deep in the curriculum. And, how is it going? So far, I am 100% confident I have made the right choice. I am *really* enjoying the material. I actually *look forward* to waking up early, every day, so that I can open my laptop and learn about coding. I am excited about all the opportunities I see in front of me, and all of the value I will be able to create. I think it’s going to be worth every penny, confused glance, canceled date, dying alternator, and exhausted morning.

Here’s to the grind.
